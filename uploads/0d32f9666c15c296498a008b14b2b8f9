The research paper titled "Identification and Classification of Fruit Defects Using Image Processing" addresses the growing
 need for efficient and automated methods for inspecting and sorting fruits based on their quality. In the context of image
 processing, this work aims to develop an algorithm that can identify defects in fruits and classify them based on digital
 image analysis. The importance of this research lies in its potential to reduce labor costs, increase efficiency, and
 ensure consistent quality in the sorting process of fruits.

Several methodologies have been explored in the literature for applying image processing techniques to agricultural
 produce and fruit quality assessment. Computer vision systems and image analysis have been widely utilized for
 tasks such as classification, identification, quality evaluation, and grading of agricultural products [4] [9].
 Various techniques have been employed to achieve accurate defect detection and classification in fruit images:

SURF technique extracts robust features from fruit images, comparing them with database images for classification
using square-shaped filters and Gaussian smoothing. Blob detection technique identifies defects in fruits by comparing
color properties and calculating the major axis for fruit size detection, crucial for sorting applications.Thresholding 
techniques, such as K-means clustering, marker-controlled watershed segmentation, Otsu's thresholding, and Gabor filtering, 
aid in defect detection by segmenting fruit images for analysis.Utilization of RGB and HSV color space models in automatic
fruit defect detection system utilizes computer vision and image 
analysis for effective segmentation.

The proposed methodology in this paper involves several stages for defect detection and classification:RGB image
undergoes pre-processing, converting to grayscale, and subsequently to binary image using filtering techniques.
Background subtraction reduces processed data, improving performance by separating fruit from background.
Feature extraction calculates fruit area relative to entire image, identifying potential defects.
Defect detection involves analyzing surface defects like scars, using contour extraction and filling.
A quality ratio threshold is applied to classify fruits as defected or fresh. Further enhancements include disease 
detection, statistical comparisons, and advanced grading methods.
